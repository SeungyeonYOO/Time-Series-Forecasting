# Time-Series-Forecasting

The projects in this repository are completed for Econ 144 class (Economic Forcasting), instructed by Professor Randall R. Rojas, during the fall quarter of 2023 at UCLA. The three projects demonstrate abilities of utilizing different approaches to model time series depending on the behavior of time series data. As metarials taught in the course get progressively more advanced, one project naturually partially includes materials from the one previous at times, thus the project 3 ultimately shocases skills and knowledge gained throughout the course.
