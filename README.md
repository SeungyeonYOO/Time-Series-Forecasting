# Time-Series-Forecasting

The projects in this repository are completed for Econ 144 class (Economic Forecasting), instructed by Professor Randall R. Rojas, during the fall quarter of 2023 at UCLA. The three projects demonstrate abilities to utilize different approaches to model time series depending on the behavior of time series data. As materials taught in the course get progressively more advanced, one project naturally partially includes materials from the one previous at times, thus project 3 ultimately showcases skills and knowledge gained throughout the course.
