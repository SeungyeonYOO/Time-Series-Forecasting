# Various Models and Accuracy Evaluation, using Performance Metrics

## Overview
This project fits various models with different strengths and weaknesses and attempts to finds out the best-performing model by evaluating their performance utilizing the performance metrics


This project explores two respective time series datasets of monthly export trades for Indonesia and Korea, from 1990 to 2023. Using the VAR model, Granger Causality analysis, and IRF (Impulse Response Function), it analyzes if there is any statistically significant causal relationship between the time series, such that the behavior of one series can help explain the other's future values. Lastly, it attempts to forecast the unknown future values using the VAR model built within the project.



## Data
The dataset used for this project are downloaded from the FRED Economic data website 
1. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CGBD2024

The observation frequency of the data is monthly and was preprocessed for analysis.
